<h3>Why do some series, subjects, etc. appear twice with exactly the same spelling?</h3>
<p>After migrating from KyBook 2 or importing books from various sources, you may find that some series, subjects, etc. <em>appear</em> to be duplicated.</p>
<p>This is most likely caused by the Unicode encoding, whereby the glyphs (characters) look the same to humans, but have different encodings (meanings to KyBook 3).</p>
<p>The problem can be solved by:</p>
<ol>
<li>excluding the affected books from their current series, subjects, etc.</li>
<li>deleting the duplicated series, subjects, etc.</li>
<li>creating the series, subjects, etc. anew</li>
<li>adding the books to the newly created series, subjects, etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>You may find the catagories in the Cataloguer useful for filtering the books by series, subjects, etc.
