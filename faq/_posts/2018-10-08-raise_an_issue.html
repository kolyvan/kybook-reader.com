<h3>How do I raise an issue I have about KyBook 3?</h3>
<p>The following information is required to raise an issue:</p>
<ol>
<li>Whether you are using an iPhone or iPad</li>
<li>What version of iOS is installed. (On the iPhone/iPad go to <code>Settings -> General -> About -> Version</code>)</li>
<li>The version of KyBook 3 installed. (In KyBook 3 go to <code>Control -> About -> KyBook 3</code>)</li>
<li>The exact steps to take to cause the issue</li>
<li>What you expected to happen</li>
<li>What actually happened</li>
</ol>
<p>Without this information it is virtually impossible to address the issue and it may be closed without a response.</p>
<p>When you have gathered the required information, search to see whether your issue has been raised before.
(You can do this by replacing the words <code>is:issue is:open </code> in the search box with a word related to your issue and pressing <code>Return</code>) here: https://github.com/kolyvan/kybook/issues</p>
<p>Once you are sure this <b>is</b> a new issue, click the<code>New issue</code> button. Make it clear whether you think your issue is a bug, feature request, or cosmetic issue, by prefixing the title with 'BUG:', 'FR:', or 'COSMETIC:' respectively.</p>
