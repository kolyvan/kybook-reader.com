<div>
<h3>What happens if I run migration from KyBook 2 to KyBook 3 more than once?</h3>
<p>Migration will only copy files from KyBook 2 that do not exist on KyBook 3, so existing files will be skipped and only missing files copied.</p>
<p>Re-running migration will be your quickest option if a previous migration failed or was stopped part-way through.</p>
